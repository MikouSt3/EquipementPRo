  # Fix Orders Table RLS Policy

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies on orders table
    - Create permissive policies for authenticated users
    - Add policies for anonymous users to enable demo functionality
    - Enable RLS policies for order_items table as well

  This migration resolves the "new row violates row-level security policy" error
  when creating orders and order items.
